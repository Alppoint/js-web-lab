# JS & Web Lab Exercises

This repo collects my Web Technologies lab work from BCA.  
Most files are small, focused examples that helped me practise core HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts.

- **array-operations.html** – Runs different operations on a fixed array (pop, push, sort, concat, join, indexOf).
- **number-stats.html** – Accepts 10 numbers, counts how many are positive, negative and zero, and lists them.
